# FilesConvertToTarGzipWithWindowsForm V0.1
This tool based on a very stupid solution which is WindowsFrom + shell
( The reason is I can't find a reliable Compress API. Actually, I found one, but its logger is a piece of shit. Although the enum class includes the gzip format with other compress formats like .zip etc., it doesn't support gzip format. WTF! LZMA needs some time to learn. I will update after I got LZMA :)
If u install Filed, make sure u had installed the .NET framework, please.

The compress tool comes from [7ZIP](https://www.7-zip.org/)

## v0.1
Because of the demand, Now Version Only Support A single File or A Directory.


# Windows打包targz工具V0.1
本工具基于非常捞的windowsForm+shell的解决方案。
如果安装出错请确保你安装了.net framework
（ps：是因为找不到靠谱的压缩API,LZMA又需要学习成本，之前找到一个假的，找了半天bug发现是源码的问题。。。

压缩工具来自于[7Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)

## V0.1
因为需求原因，只支持单个文件打包或者单个文件夹打包，目前版本多个文件打包请放到同一目录下进行打包
